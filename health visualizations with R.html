Summary of Findings
</br>  
Data from Fitbit shows that users steps increase from March to April, likely as the weather improves for longer outdoor activity. In April, a sizable portion of Fitbit users exceeded 10,000 steps per day, with multiple days exceeding 20,000 steps. 
</br>
Fitbit user weight is wide-ranging, spanning from under 125 pounds to over 275 pounds, meaning a wide range of people are interested in monitoring their health. While only one subjectâ€™s Fitbit recorded a heart rate over 200 beats per minute, all subjects exceeded 150 beats in regular fashion. 
</br>
Finally, Gallup shows that the 45-64 age bracket has an obesity rate of 45%, the highest of any demographic. The total US adult obesity rate is nearly 40%.
